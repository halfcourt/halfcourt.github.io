about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am currently a Data & Analytics Manager on a B2B Marketing team and recently in 2020, I graduated from the Harvard Business Analytics Program with Distinction. 
  
  I began a career in data because I enjoy working on initiatives that use statistics to enhance existing operational capabilities as well as explore new innovative ways to optimize business strategies for future value creation.

  I am a firm believer that through Marketing's online and offline engagements, that data can provide more value to an organization than generally perceived, and that business operations who choose to enable and leverage this data for insight and growth will ultimately succeed.

  My core experience is working with B2B Marketing and Sales data, but I am always open to explore new areas of growth through data analysis. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Asking Questions</mark> <mark>Uncovering Answers</mark> <mark>Creating Solutions</mark>
